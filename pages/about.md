## About the Creator

Ean Teague is a Master of Library Science student at Indiana University Bloomington.  Previously, Ean earned a bachelor's degree in History from The Ohio State University.  Ean is an avid board gamer and a yearly attendee to Origins Game Fair and Gen Con.  Card and board games have been a major part of his life since childhood, and he has met some of his closest friends through boardgaming.  His hope is that others will find the fun and community that board games and card games can build.

## About the Collection

This collection features just a small number of the over 200-plus games collected by Ean and his friends over the past decade.  Included are some favorites, old and new, alond with information about each game.  The hypothetical use for the collection is a situation in which a board game club is founded at a local library, public or academic, and that this website would be used to curate available games.

## Acknowledgements

The "Game Mechanics" metadata uses the vocabulary from BoardGameGeek, which can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamemechanic).  Themes metadata uses a custom vocabulary intended to simplify the taxonomy of the games in the collection.  All other metadata comes from information available on or inside each game's respective box or container.
