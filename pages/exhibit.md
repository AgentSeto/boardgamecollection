Just One is a party game in which the guesser will show a word on a card to the table without looking, and everyone is tasked with writing down a word that might lead them to guess the secret word.; Watch out, though!  Before the guesser gets a chance to guess, everyone will compare their words, and if any words are repeated, that word is not shown to the guesser.  Try to think of some unique clues!" %}
