## Check out these party-size games!

Many games out there have a limit to how many players can play - not always best for big groups!  Here are some selections from our collection for games you can play with a group:

<br/>
### Just One (3-7 players, up to 8 players or teams)

{% include feature/image.html objectid="justone_box;justone_rules" width="60" caption="Just One can be played with up to eight players (don't mind that the box says seven!).  Just One is a party game in which the guesser will show a word on a card to the table without looking, and everyone is tasked with writing down a word that might lead them to guess the secret word.; Watch out, though!  Before the guesser gets a chance to guess, everyone will compare their words, and if any words are repeated, that word is not shown to the guesser.  Try to think of some unique clues!" %}

### So Clover (3-6 players, but good for large groups)

Then, each player gives the clover to the rest of the table, that try to use the clues to put it back together (this is where anyone can get involved!)" %}
